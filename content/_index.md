title: Dr Ali J. Ghandour
summary: I am an associate researcher at the Lebanese National Center for Remote Sensing - National Council for Scientific Research (CNRS), where I have established the Geospatial Earth Observation (GEO) group. I earned a Ph.D. in Computer Communication in 2013 and was with Toyota Motor North America, InfoTech Labs at Mountain View, USA, before joining CNRS in 2015, where I also acted as the coordinator of the Lebanese National Innovation Transfer Network. I have over 30 publications with unique research focus on AI-assisted mapping spanning various applications, including geospatial Earth observation, urban analytics, transportation, and features extraction from aerial imagery. I develop tools integrating deep learning techniques to automate the process of urban features extraction and collect crowd-sourcing data from various sources. Evidence gained from my models and data analysis allows for a robust humanitarian response and provides policymakers and key stakeholders with insights to design tailored regulations and safety countermeasures for urban social good. In the past, I made research contributions to vehicular cognitive networks and IEEE P1609 standard Working Group.
