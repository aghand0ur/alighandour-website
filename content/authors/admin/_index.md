I am an associate researcher at the Lebanese National Center for Remote Sensing - National Council for Scientific Research (CNRS) where I have established the Geospatial Earth Observation (GEO) group. I earned a Ph.D. in Computer Communication in 2013 and was with Toyota Motor North America, InfoTech Labs at Mountain View, USA before joining CNRS in 2015 where I also acted as the coordinator of the Lebanese National Innovation Transfer Network.

I have more than 30 publications with special research focus on **AI-assisted mapping** spanning various applications including geospatial urban sensing, transportation and urban features extraction from aerial imagery. I develop tools integrating deep learning techniques to automate the process of urban features extraction and collect crowd-sourcing data from various sources. Evidence gained from my models and data analysis allows for a robust humanitarian response and provides policymakers and key stakeholders with insights to design tailored regulations and safety countermeasures for urban social good. In the past, I made research contributions to vehicular cognitive networks and IEEE P1609 standard Working Group.
